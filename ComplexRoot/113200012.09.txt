I created a class named Complex. I added add, subtract, multiply and divide 
methodsin the Complex class. Then i typed a toString method for complex numbers.

In design I have created 2 edit texts which are for the real and imaginary parts
of a complex number. And I added 2 text views which are fore adding and 
multiplying. I also created 2 more buttons. One for create a complex number and
the second one for make the calculations that I have mentioned.

I have created an array list for complex number. When the ‘create complex’ 
button hit, program should take complex numbers coefficients from editTexts and
create an complex number. I have set an o’n click listener for that button.

I have created an Complex object and added two methods in Polynomial class which
are addPoly and multPoly these two methods adds and multiplies a polynomial with
a complex number. 

I have added another method that makeAnotherFromRoots. The method takes a 
polynomial and an array of complex then gives a complex polynomial but it gives
error and I can’t find out why.
