I have created a class named polynomial. I typed it’s variable which is an array
of double coefficients. Under this class I typed the methods that we used
previous project.

In differentiate method when i typed ‘return new Polynomial(result)’ I gives and
error which can’t get why. Because it will obviously give another polynomial and 
we have written that code in the lecture.

In find root method it gives error at the while statement. I can’t type the 
method that i have typed in mainActivity.

I can’t go far. I need to learn how to type methods in classes. I have watched 
many videos but they doesn’t give an answer to my problems. Also I don’t know 
how to call them in mainActivity.
