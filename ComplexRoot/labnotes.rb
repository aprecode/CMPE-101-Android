We talked about course policies and sowfware that we will use and advantages of Git.

First i tried to open vas in the android then i asked and the teacher said that 
i should have closed it and then try to open it.

I couldn’t manage to push a project to Git for a while

I recognised my mistake. I should have forked it in git the modify and push it to Git.

I followed the steps. First I modified the program as it is told mo to do. 
I started emulator but the program didn’t came to the screen. I decreased ram to run it. 
Then i committed changes and push it to my Git

I don’t have enough time to start the project. I’ll do it later.

Famous mathematician Godfrey Hardy visited him. The cab number that Hardy used was 1729.
