I’ve searched for array and for structures. 
I don’t know how to make user select an element from an array and calculate it with my method

I’ve searched more but i still don’t know how to manage that problem. 
I can create an array but I’m not sure that should i create another class for it.

I’ve changed my whole design from the latest project. 
I’ll try to make a list view of scroll view -something like that- 
But I’m not sure yet how to make user to make a decision between those array items. 

I renounce the idea of make user the decision with clicking on values because it’s 
hard to do it with my java knowledge so far. 
I will make 4 inputs and these inputs will hold the values that user will type in arrays.


I renounce that idea either. I have made one input which is for salary, one textview for nett salary 
and a dialog page for band and tax inputs so that user can identify s/he’s own band and tax choices. 

I open an another xml file for dialog page. I have added two spinners in dialog page. 
Spinners will contain two separate lists. One of them will contain bands and the other one will taxes.
User will choose two of bands and three of taxes from lists. These selections will be put in arrays.

I had problem with spinners but I realize that i forgot to type “dialog.show()”.

As I said user will choose two bands and three taxes but i don’t know how to make user 
choose three choices on one spinners so I created 3 spinners for each.
One spinner of bands will contain only “Rest” means rests tax rate.

The program works in the correct way.
